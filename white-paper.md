# Summary
## Executive summary
Virtual Reality (VR) is a new experience that creates unusual closeness and maximum immersion. This technology facilitates immersive learning environments that are not usually accessible to the students. The competencies generated by students from VR include spatial visualization, innovative thinking, problem-solving, critical thinking, and empathy.

## Expert Summary
Virtual Reality (VR) uses computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience. By simulating as many senses as possible such as vision, hearing, touch, even smell the computer is transformed into a gatekeeper to this artificial world.

# Foreword
This white paper is intended for people who wish to know more about the concepts of Virtual Reality (VR). The author has explained briefly about the evolution, characteristics, and application of VR. And the paper details more on the application of VR in the field of education and it’s futuristic approach.
# Preface
Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging field developed by the union of technologies and it is used to visualize and interact with the virtual atmosphere.  The virtual world is computer generated surrounds the user by involving one or more senses through the appropriate system. It has great importance in transforming and upgrading the core components, extensive smart devices, network transmission devices, cloud computing devices, telecom services, and software and industry information services. 
In this white paper, VR is discussed in terms of its evolution, its differences with Augmented Reality (AR), general applications, application in education, pros and cons of VR in education and the futuristic approach.

## 1. Introduction
The term Virtual Reality has its self-definition with ‘virtual’ referring to ‘near’ and ‘reality’ referring to the real-time experience by human beings. So, it basically means a near-reality. According to Britannica, virtual reality (VR), uses computer modeling and simulation that enables a person to interact with an artificial three-dimensional (3-D) visual or other sensory environments. VR applications involve the user in a computer-generated environment that simulates reality through the use of interactive devices, which send and receive information and are worn as goggles, headsets, gloves, or bodysuits. In a typical VR format, a user wearing a helmet with a stereoscopic screen views animated images of a simulated environment. Although the technology seems to be futuristic, its evolution dates back to the 1950s.
### i. Evolution of VR

| **Year** | **Achievement** |
| -----|:-----------: |
| 1956 | The first VR system developed was the Sensorama which was mentioned as future of cinema. |
| 1965 | Concept of ultimate display was developed wherein a head mounted visual output device that displayed computer generated images on a monitor near to the eyes. |
| 1980s | VIEW system was developed included device like data gloves and head trackers. |
| 1987 - 1989 | Discussion on the concept of interface hardware, huma- computer interactive interface held and the term Virtual Reality was coined. |
| 1990s-early 2000s | The simulation and emulation environments based on VR extended to various reasearches in the field of military, science, engineering, education, medicine, business, art, entertainment and other fields. |
| 2008-2013 | Five element (5P) topology was introduced. Purpose,place,platform,population and profit terms were taken into account for the usage of VR |
| 2014 | VR offers  communication options for the users who in the virtual world will be able to engage in real time synchronous interactions. |
| To date | Subsequent researches extended the definitionof immersion of user's interaction with environment and objects within it to the interaction between different users Immersion and interaction was considered as a most important and widely accepted characteristics of VR. |
### ii. Difference between Augmented and Virtual Reality

| **Augmented Reality** | **Virtual Reality** |
| --------------------- | :-------------------:|
| The user looks into the real world with the additional environment being displayed | The real surroundings are not perceived by the user and everything is virtual |
| The user will be able to experience Augmented Reality (AR) just with a smartphone, tablet, heads-up display, holographic system sometimes AR glasses may be required | The user will experience the 3D world by using VR glasses, the virtual world can be viewed, heard, and experienced. |
| AR is mainly used in explaining the installation, navigation, and at times for gaming purposes | VR is mainly used in industries, educational training, 3D games, entertainment, and media. |
| AR simply uses mobile devices so their performance is minimal | Though VR’s performance depends on the capability of the computer systems it provides a 360-degree view of the images and videos in the 3D world |
### iii. Types and characteristics of VR
As per (Dejian Liu, 2017), VR is generally classified into two and they are,
- Game-oriented VR – it has precise rules and regulations and has limited activities like creating certain characters.
- Socially-oriented VR – grants users unlimited freedom to create their characters to get engaged in virtual activities.

There are three major characteristics of VR – Immersion, Interaction, and Imagination.
- **Immersion –** Refers to the immersive experience of being there in a 3D environment. It focuses on verisimilitude and multiple simulations of the environment.
- **Interaction –** Refers to the interaction of the user with the 3D world and with other users. The main intention is the natural interaction in the VR environment and interpersonal interaction between different users
- **Imagination –** Enables people to imagine things that don’t exist in the real world, increases perceptual and natural knowledge, deepens the understanding of concepts, and trigger new associations
