## 1. Introduction
The term Virtual Reality has its self-definition with ‘virtual’ referring to ‘near’ and ‘reality’ referring to the real-time experience by human beings. So, it basically means a near-reality. According to Britannica, virtual reality (VR), uses computer modeling and simulation that enables a person to interact with an artificial three-dimensional (3-D) visual or other sensory environments. VR applications involve the user in a computer-generated environment that simulates reality through the use of interactive devices, which send and receive information and are worn as goggles, headsets, gloves, or bodysuits. In a typical VR format, a user wearing a helmet with a stereoscopic screen views animated images of a simulated environment. Although the technology seems to be futuristic, its evolution dates back to the 1950s.

### i. Evolution of VR
<h4 align="center">Table 1 Evolution of VR, Source: (Dejian Liu, 2017)</h4>

| **Year** | **Achievement** |
| -----|:-----------: |
| 1956 | The first VR system developed was the Sensorama which was mentioned as future of cinema. |
| 1965 | Concept of ultimate display was developed wherein a head mounted visual output device that displayed computer generated images on a monitor near to the eyes. |
| 1980s | VIEW system was developed included device like data gloves and head trackers. |
| 1987 - 1989 | Discussion on the concept of interface hardware, huma- computer interactive interface held and the term Virtual Reality was coined. |
| 1990s-early 2000s | The simulation and emulation environments based on VR extended to various reasearches in the field of military, science, engineering, education, medicine, business, art, entertainment and other fields. |
| 2008-2013 | Five element (5P) topology was introduced. Purpose,place,platform,population and profit terms were taken into account for the usage of VR |
| 2014 | VR offers  communication options for the users who in the virtual world will be able to engage in real time synchronous interactions. |
| To date | Subsequent researches extended the definitionof immersion of user's interaction with environment and objects within it to the interaction between different users Immersion and interaction was considered as a most important and widely accepted characteristics of VR. |

<h4 align="center">Table 2 Difference between AR and BR, Source: (Sensolligent, 2018)</h4>

| **Augmented Reality** | **Virtual Reality** |
| --------------------- | :-------------------:|
| The user looks into the real world with the additional environment being displayed | The real surroundings are not perceived by the user and everything is virtual |
| The user will be able to experience Augmented Reality (AR) just with a smartphone, tablet, heads-up display, holographic system sometimes AR glasses may be required | The user will experience the 3D world by using VR glasses, the virtual world can be viewed, heard, and experienced. |
| AR is mainly used in explaining the installation, navigation, and at times for gaming purposes | VR is mainly used in industries, educational training, 3D games, entertainment, and media. |
| AR simply uses mobile devices so their performance is minimal | Though VR’s performance depends on the capability of the computer systems it provides a 360-degree view of the images and videos in the 3D world |

### iii. Types and characteristics of VR
As per (Dejian Liu, 2017), VR is generally classified into two and they are,
- **Game-oriented VR –** it has precise rules and regulations and has limited activities like creating certain characters.
- **Socially-oriented VR –** grants users unlimited freedom to create their characters to get engaged in virtual activities.

There are three major characteristics of VR – _**Immersion, Interaction, and Imagination**_.
- **Immersion –** Refers to the immersive experience of being there in a 3D environment. It focuses on verisimilitude and multiple simulations of the environment.
- **Interaction –** Refers to the interaction of the user with the 3D world and with other users. The main intention is the natural interaction in the VR environment and interpersonal interaction between different users
- **Imagination –** Enables people to imagine things that don’t exist in the real world, increases perceptual and natural knowledge, deepens the understanding of concepts, and trigger new associations

### i. Applications of VR in education
Though the utility of VR in the field of education is in the preliminary stage, still it brought into conventional classrooms on a large scale. VR can create a virtual learning environment especially for objects that are difficult to touch or even those that do not exist in the real world, e.g., avionics and retroactive imaging. The students can investigate and control 3D intelligent conditions with the help of VR. (Dejian Liu, 2017). Look at _**Appendix**_ for more details on how VR is used in the classroom.
 Based on the number of previous studies, the application of VR can be divided into 4 types
- Observational learning
- Operational learning
- Social learning
- Academic research

#### a. Observational learning
With the help of VR students’ conduct and development can be changed to a 3D space that encourages them to explore the virtual activities. Students will be able to freely navigate in virtual environments and obtain the initiative feelings for the things present inside different spatial perspectives. Students can therefore get a better understanding of characteristics, construction, and other relevant processing of learning targets. 
The virtual campus is one of the best examples to state as an application of VR which simulates a real campus using 3D virtual technology. The virtual campus can help students to be familiar with the campus environment and the facilities available before they enter the institution. 
##### Figure 2 Virtual campus using VR, Source: (Dejian Liu, 2017)
<img width="512" alt="virtual_campus_using_VR" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99115563/152803804-ba11122a-e022-4c12-8e9f-57c5fd1a00e8.png">
The other supportive systems like a virtual ground such as open space, amusement space, participation space, and study halls are also created using VR. This gives room for synchronous lectures, rich plugins that can boost the interaction between students and teachers.

VR technology not only simulates the scenes behind the real world but also transcends the limits of time, space, and human senses to retrieve the scenes that do not exist in current society, by using VR technology the physical space can be zoomed in and transferred to represent micro and macro worlds. Therefore, this technology can be widely used in science education, for instance, to learn about astronomy, explore the structure of molecules and cells, etc. (Dejian Liu, 2017) (Kunjal Ahir, 2019)

#### b. Operational Learning
The VR technology opened up space for tangible learning. With the help of the learning atmosphere created by VR, the student will be able to work with the objects, hands-on to observe and experience the working.
Simultaneously the students will get immediate feedback for their operations and behaviors that helps them to correct their wrong operation and gives better understanding during the learning process. The VR technology simulates the real scenes in skill training, it provides opportunities to the student to practice over and over, facilitating the skill transfer into real tasks.
Some of the examples like medical operation and driving can have their costs high in real-time and endangered too. VR technology provides a training platform more conveniently and safely. 
In real-time, the Science Space project was developed using NASA’s fund includes a virtual platform called ‘Newton World’, which can simulate the scenes where there is no gravity and friction. The learners will be able to launch and catch balls with different masses via the virtual hands, through which they can understand Newton’s law of motion and the law of conservation of energy. (Dejian Liu, 2017) (Kunjal Ahir, 2019)

#### c. Social Learning
Social learning under VR technology is said to be the most significant one. The students will be able to study through interaction and co-operation with others in the simulated environment.  
The teacher and students will be able to conduct social learning activities with better interaction, hence VR technology is most suitable for distance education as it can bypass the limitations of physical distance.
The student will be able to participate in the real-time class interaction and complete the group discussions through the multi-user virtual platform. VR technology not only facilitates the co-operation among different learners in multi-user virtual platforms but also establishes the connection between the students and virtual avatars promoting the information exchange. (Dejian Liu, 2017)

#### d. Scientific research
In addition to teaching, VR technology also has great importance in scientific research. Many academic institutions use VR labs, especially for the science areas. VR technology can simulate various science and engineering environments as a result of which it can decrease the cost and risk of conducting experiments in laboratories.
Additionally, VR technology can simulate and create some scenes and effects that cannot be achieved in the real world through which the experimental conditions can be manipulated and controlled flexibility. For example, VR technology can be used to visualize the internal organs and makes sense to the researchers on the operation.

> VR often has a limited scope or lack of ready-made teaching scenarios. 
> 
> There is a possibility of making users addicted to the virtual world.
> 
> VR limits interpersonal contacts and experiences. 
### iv. Futuristic approach of VR in education
In the future, VR is likely to lead to an increasing emphasis on interdisciplinary perspectives and technical writing, while the use of video-game-based technologies will contribute to changes in the look and feel of the class environment.
The adoption and integration of VR in education will also signal a much-needed shift away from learning that is too abstract and disconnected from practice and experience. It empowers students by offering a more experimental mode of learning and promoting the need for conceptual understanding.
The development of the virtual classroom is likely to move the education towards immersive and interactive learning environments, involving various components such as games, field trips, and simulations to make learning more effective, more hands-on, and more fun. (Kunjal Ahir, 2019).
